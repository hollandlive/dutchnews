web-site dutchnews.ru re-development

First wordpress site I made in 2014

Redevelopment.

After many trying of 

- Docker (problem with config)
- Vagrant/VirtualBox (too heavy for my MacBook Air)
- Native stack (config on Mojave sucked my mind today)

Installed with Laravel Valet as the most easy and lightweight
